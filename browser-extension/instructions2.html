<h1>Welcome! And thank you for participating</h1>
<p>You are about to participate in a user study for a anti-phishing browser plugin. This plugin is a proof-of-concept that is based on a novel technique on recognizing phishing pages.<br/><br/>

The purpose of this user study is to get insight into the usability of the developed browser extension and phishing detection method. We therefore ask you to participate in this study.<br/><br/>

Your behaviour on the pages is not tracked or collected. Your data of interacting with the pages is not stored in any way. Your answers from the questionnaire are anonymous, saved and used for analyses on the usability of the extension and to make future improvements.<br/><br/>

This study and data collection are performed under ethical approval no. erb2020mcs13 issued by the TU Eindhoven Ethical Review Board.<br/><br/>

In this instruction we will get you and your browser ready for the tasks. Please first follow the steps on how to install the plugin.
</p>
<div style="position: fixed; top:35%; left:9%;width: 12%;height: auto;border: 1px dashed #000; padding:5px;"><p>If you experience any technical difficulties or have other questions, please contact Sam (<a href="https://wa.me/0031639474205">whatsapp link</a>) or Ardela (<a href="https://wa.me/0031638416306">whatsapp link</a>) anytime.</p></div>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>Step 1: Install the Google Chrome browser</h2>
<p>Please download and install the Google Chrome browser from <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">here</a> if you do not have it already.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Launch Chrome with special parameters</h2>
<p>For the proper functioning of the phishing pages in Chrome, you are going to launch Chrome in a specific way.<br/><br/>
For Windows, please download <a href="http://tilbury2.fortiddns.com:5000/static/chrome_shortcut.zip">this</a> chrome shortcut, unzip the archive (it contains a single file), close all of your open Chrome windows and execute the shortcut. Your computer might warn you about a downloaded executable file, you can ignore this. The shortcut only launches Chrome for you with some settings.
<!--open a command prompt (you can do this by opening your start menu and typing "cmd" and pressing enter). Afterwards paste <span style="background-color: #aaa;">"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-web-security</span> (<b>with</b> the quotes!) and press enter. Chrome should launch. If it does not launch, try pasting <span style="background-color: #aaa;">"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-web-security</span> in the command prompt and press enter. -->
</p>
<p>For MacOS, open a terminal (this is just an app that you can launch like all others, called "terminal"), and paste <span style="background-color: #aaa;">/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --disable-web-security</span> into your terminal and press enter.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Install the plugin</h2>
<p>You can download the zip from <a target="_blank" href="http://tilbury2.fortiddns.com:5000/static/AntiPhishing.zip">here</a>. Please unzip this anywhere on your PC. On Windows you can right-click the zip file and select "Extract all...". It will extract
the files into a folder called AntiPhishing by default. On MacOS, simply double clicking the zip file will should extract the files.</p>
<p>After unzipping, go to your open browser window. Go to the extensions manager page (you can do this by clicking the puzzle piece icon in the top right and afterwards clicking "manage extensions". Alternatively, you can type "chrome://extensions/" (without quotes!) in your address bar and press enter.</p>
<p>Turn on "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle in the top right corner of the page. Afterwards, click "Load unpacked" in the top left corner. Choose the folder to which you have unpacked the downloaded files.</p>
<p>Last thing to do is make sure that the extension icon is in your toolbar. Click the puzzle piece icon in the top right of your screen, and click the pin icon next to the anti-phishing plugin</p>
<p>You are now done installing!</p>

<h1>The plugin: a tour</h1>
<p>Now that you've successfully installed the plugin, we'll give you a tour.</p>
<p>Starting with the extension icon in the top right toolbar. This is a traffic light design with the following possibilities: red means phishing detected. Yellow means the detection process is still running. Green means the website is detected legitimate. A question mark indicates the result of detection was inconclusive. The icon might also show a red box with a number. If this number is 3, for example, this means that there are 3 websites detected as phishing from your past visited websites.</p>
<img src="http://tilbury2.fortiddns.com:5000/static/icons.png" />
<p>Clicking on the icon opens a pop-up. This pop-up shows you the detailed detection process progress. The progress is updated automatically, but you can also press the update button. The pop-up also shows the result of the detection if available. Finally, the pop-up contains a list of previously detected phishing websites (which is empty after installing). You can open this pop-up at any time during your tasks.</p>
<img src="http://tilbury2.fortiddns.com:5000/static/pop-up.png" />
<p>Upon clicking a password field on a page while the detection process is not yet finished, a warning will show.</p>
<img src="http://tilbury2.fortiddns.com:5000/static/tooltip.png" />
<p>Finally, when a page has been detected as phishing, a warning screen will show. The warning screen gives you information on why it is shown. It also, if you wish so, gives you the option to ignore the warning or to whitelist the page if you think the warning is shown by mistake.</p>

<h1>The process</h1>
<p>Now that you are familiar with the plugin, this is what we ask you to do. You are going to visit 10 pages, in which your simple task is to login. Some are phishing pages, and some are legitimate pages.
    You can decide for yourself whether you want to login or not. You can use the tool as described to guide you in making your decesions. You do not have to wait until the detection process is done if you do not want to. Try not to get phished!
</p>
<p>We obviously do not want you to fill in your own credentials. Therefore, for <b>every</b> website, your credentials are:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Username/email: antiphishingplugin@gmail.com</li>
    <li>Password: AntiPhish2022!</li>
</ul>
Please use these credentials, and not your own! <strong>The phishing pages are not real phishing pages and are under our control.</strong>

<h1>Uninstalling the plugin</h1>
