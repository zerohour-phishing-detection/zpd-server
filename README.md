A Decision-Support Tool for Experimentation on Zero-Hour Phishing Detection. Burda, P., Allodi, L., Zannone, N. (2023). In: Foundations and Practice of Security. FPS 2022. LNCS, vol 13877. Springer. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-30122-3_27

## Abstract
>New, sophisticated phishing campaigns victimize targets in few hours from attack delivery. 
Some methods, such as visual similarity-based techniques, can spot these zero-hour attacks, at the cost of additional user intervention.
However, more research is needed to investigate the trade-off between automatic detection and user intervention. 
To enable this line of research, we present a phishing detection tool that can be used to instrument scientific research in this direction.
The tool can be used for experimentation on assisting user decision-making, evaluating user trust in detection, and keeping track of users' previous ''bad''
decisions.

## Usage
First, dependencies in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and python3 shall be installed.
Then, there are several steps to test the scripts:
- [The API](api.py) starts the flask API server with `python3 api.py` (or via `flask app run`, keep in mind the `PATH` variables for this)
	- The server runs locally on port 5000
	- POST requests can be built, such as:
		- >test_json = {
		- > "URL": "https://idsrv.lv1871.de/Login",
		- > "uuid": "63054094-01c4-11ed-b939-0242ac120002", # "client uuid" (any text is valid)
		- > "pagetitle": "Lebensversicherung von 1871 a. G. MÃ¼nchen",
		- > "image64": "",	#optional
		- > "phishURL" : "http://bogusurl1.co.uk"	#optional
		- >}
	- the output of the process can be found in [sessions.db](db/sessions.db) and [output_operational.db](db/output_operational.db)
- [evaluation](evaluation) contains scripts to automate the evaluation from a sample of phishing/non-phishing sites
	- The used dataset for sampling benign and phishing data can be found [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/xndCmdvb7yzM8ED).
- [check-classifiers.py](script/check-classifiers.py) and [hit-verifier.py](script/hit-verifier.py) are middleware to pre-process `output_operational.db` for the evaluation
- [ROC.py](script/ROC.py) carries out the final evaluation with two databases as input ('phishing' and 'benign')

## Ready to run VM
A ready to run deployment is available as an OVA image for VirtualBox [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/88nDPEFemrKmwCg) (Ubuntu 20).
