A Decision-Support Tool for Experimentation on Zero-Hour Phishing Detection. Burda, P., Allodi, L., Zannone, N. (2023). In: Foundations and Practice of Security. FPS 2022. LNCS, vol 13877. Springer. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-30122-3_27

## Abstract
>New, sophisticated phishing campaigns victimize targets in few hours from attack delivery. 
Some methods, such as visual similarity-based techniques, can spot these zero-hour attacks, at the cost of additional user intervention.
However, more research is needed to investigate the trade-off between automatic detection and user intervention. 
To enable this line of research, we present a phishing detection tool that can be used to instrument scientific research in this direction.
The tool can be used for experimentation on assisting user decision-making, evaluating user trust in detection, and keeping track of users' previous ''bad''
decisions.

## Usage
First, dependencies in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and python3 shall be installed.
Then, there are several steps to test the scripts:
- [The API](api.py) starts the flask API server with `python3 api.py` (or via `flask app run`, keep in mind the `PATH` variables for this)
	- The server runs locally on port 5000
	- POST requests can be built, such as:
		- >test_json = {
		- > "URL": "https://idsrv.lv1871.de/Login",
		- > "uuid": "63054094-01c4-11ed-b939-0242ac120002", # "client uuid" (any text is valid)
		- > "pagetitle": "Lebensversicherung von 1871 a. G. MÃ¼nchen",
		- > "image64": "",	#optional
		- > "phishURL" : "http://bogusurl1.co.uk"	#optional
		- >}
	- the output of the process can be found in [sessions.db](db/sessions.db) and [output_operational.db](db/output_operational.db)
- [evaluation](evaluation) contains scripts to automate the evaluation from a sample of phishing/non-phishing sites
	- The used dataset for sampling benign and phishing data can be found [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/xndCmdvb7yzM8ED).
- [check-classifiers.py](script/check-classifiers.py) and [hit-verifier.py](script/hit-verifier.py) are middleware to pre-process `output_operational.db` for the evaluation
- [ROC.py](script/ROC.py) carries out the final evaluation with two databases as input ('phishing' and 'benign')

## Google Cloud Vision setup
To be able to use Google Cloud Vision Logo Detection (based in `vision_logo_detection.py`),
you need to add a `.gcloud_creds.json` file, containing a service account key to a Google Cloud Service Account.

### Obtaining Google Cloud Credentials
If you've just started working on this project and noone else has set up Google Cloud yet, you can follow these steps.
1. Sign up for [Google Cloud Free Trial](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial). This requires a credit card, but you will not be deducted any money from it. Keep in mind that using a virtual credit card and with a fresh Google account may not work, as you may get an error message (likely because of fraud prevention).
2. Make a project, or just use the initial empty project if you don't plan on using Google Cloud for anything else.
3. Make a Service account (Navigation menu > IAM and admin > Service accounts). No permissions need to be granted. No users need to be granted access.
4. Create keys for the service account (click account > open 'keys' tab), in JSON format. For security purposes, do not share your key with other people, instead make new keys for your fellow developers. If you want, you can also create a service account per developer, that way you can track API usage per person.
5. Keep in mind that this method of providing credentials is the least recommended of all ways Google Cloud allows you to identify, and it is only recommended for a development environment. If you wish to create a proper production setup, see the [Google Cloud docs](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication).
