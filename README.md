Code and test data for anti-phishing tool: A decision-support tool for experimentation on zero-hour phishing detection (in submission) - Pavlo Burda, Luca Allodi and Nicola Zannone, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands

## Abstract
>New, sophisticated phishing campaigns victimize targets in few hours from attack delivery.
Some techniques can spot these zero-hour attacks, at the cost of additional user intervention. Further research is needed to fill this gap.
We present a phishing detection tool that enables research on zero-hour detection and user intervention trade-offs.

## Usage
First, dependencies in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and python3 shall be installed.
Then, there are two steps to test the scripts:
- [Flask API](api.py) start the flask API server with `python3 api.py` (or via `flask app run`, keep in mind the `PATH` variables for this)
	- The server runs locally on port 5000
	- POST request can be built, such as:
	- >test_json = {
	> "URL": "https://idsrv.lv1871.de/Login",
	> "uuid": "63054094-01c4-11ed-b939-0242ac120002",
	> "pagetitle": "Lebensversicherung von 1871 a. G. MÃ¼nchen",
	> "image64": "",
	> "phishURL" : "http://bogusurl1.co.uk"
	>}
